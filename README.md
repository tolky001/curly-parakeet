Let's say you want to buy Apple and, at various times want to find out how cheap it is relative to its highest EV/EBITDA ratio over the last five years.  In this first, simple, project, I find the highest EV/Ebitda ratio for the last five years for Apple (.i.e. from 6/30/17-6/30/22) and then have a customer input today's EV/EBITDA ratio for Apple to output exactly how much Apple's current EV/EBITDA ratio is lower/higher than its 5 year high from 6/30/22:  EV/EBITDA ratio is a common metric for how cheap a stock is.

In the second, simple, project, I merge (inner join) Apple's EV/EBITDA ratio CSV from 6/30/17-6/30/22 with Apple's Stock price CSV from 6/30/17-6/30/22.  I  clean the second CSV and then merge the exact same dates, in case somebody wants to work with Apple's EV/EBITDA ratio and stock price from 6/30/17-6/30/22!
