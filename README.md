A very simple project where I find the highest EV/Ebitda ratio for the last five years for Apple (.i.e. from 6/30/17-6/30/22) and then have a customer input today's EV/EBITDA ratio for Apple to output exactly how much Apple's current EV/EBITDA ratio is lower/higher than its 5 year high from 6/30/22:  EV/EBITDA ratio is a common metric for how cheap a stock is.
